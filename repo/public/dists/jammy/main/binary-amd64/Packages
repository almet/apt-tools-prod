Description: OCI container runtime monitor
 Conmon is a monitoring program and communication tool between a container
 manager (like podman or CRI-O) and an OCI runtime (like runc or crun) for a
 single container.
 .
 Upon being launched, it double-forks to daemonize and detach from the parent
 that launched it. It then launches the runtime as its child. This allows
 managing processes to die in the foreground, but still be able to watch over
 and connect to the child process (the container).
 .
 While the container runs, conmon does two things:
 .
 - Provides a socket for attaching to the container, holding open the
   container's standard streams and forwarding them over the socket.
 - Writes the contents of the container's streams to a log file (or to the
   systemd journal) so they can be read after the container's death.
 .
 Finally, upon the containers death, conmon will record its exit time and code
 to be read by the managing programs.
 .
 Written in C and designed to have a low memory footprint, conmon is intended to
 be run by a container managing library. Essentially, conmon is the smallest
 daemon a container can have.

Description: Take potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images
 Dangerzone is an open source desktop application that takes potentially dangerous PDFs, office documents, or images and converts them to safe PDFs. It uses disposable VMs on Qubes OS, or container technology in other OSes, to convert the documents within a secure sandbox.
